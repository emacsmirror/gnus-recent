Avoid having to open Gnus and find the right Group just to get back to
that e-mail you were reading.

Or hit a key while reading one article to pop back through the stack
of previously read articles, even if they were in a different Group.

Or insert a link to a recently read e-mail in an org-mode buffer by
just picking one with [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/][ivy]]:

* Installation

# ** MELPA
# If you use [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], you can just do =M-x list-packages=, find
# =gnus-recent= in the list and hit =i x=.

** Manual
Just put =gnus-recent.el= (and optionally =gnus-recent-ivy.el=)
somewhere in =load-path=.


* Usage

After reading some articles in Gnus and then doing whatever, doing
=gnus-recent-goto-previous= will open the last read article and rotate
the list, so you can keep calling it to go further back.

Doing =gnus-recent-ivy= will let you pick an article to
re-open. Hitting =M-o l= will insert an =org-mode= link to the article
instead.

** Manual, loading on startup:

To use, require and bind whatever keys you prefer to the
interactive function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'gnus-recent)
  (define-key gnus-summary-mode-map (kbd "l") #'gnus-recent-goto-previous) ;
  (define-key gnus-group-mode-map (kbd "C-c L") #'gnus-recent-goto-previous)

  (require 'gnus-recent-ivy)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f3>") #'gnus-recent-ivy)
#+END_SRC

** With use-package, enabled after org:

If you prefer =use-package=, the above settings would be:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package gnus-recent
    :load-path "~/src/gnus-recent"       ; wherever you checked this out
    :after gnus
    :config
    (define-key gnus-summary-mode-map (kbd "l") #'gnus-recent-goto-previous)
    (define-key gnus-group-mode-map (kbd "C-c L") #'gnus-recent-goto-previous))

  (use-package gnus-recent-ivy
    :load-path "~/src/gnus-recent"       ; wherever you checked this out
    :after gnus
    :bind (("<f3>" . gnus-recent-ivy)))
#+END_SRC
